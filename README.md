## Hello! Welcome to my website. 

My name is Sunny Yan. I'm an aspiring data scientist that is passionate about telling stories through data. My main skills are working with Python and the Pydata stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for data analysis, but I am also proficient using SQL and R. 

I graduated with a degree in Political Science from Columbia University in 2019 before starting my career in Software Sales. During these two experiences I gained a solid understanding of basic statistics and also saw how companies fail to leverage their own business data into business insights and strategy improvements. I knew that this was something that I was interested in improving and working with, which drew me into the field of data science. 

I started my Data Science Journey by completing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera, this series of courses gave me a great introduction to the field. It taught me how to analyze datasets using python, but more importantly, how to think like a data scientist. 

After completing the course I decided to continue my learning journey by pursuing another Data Science certificate from Dataquest. The reason I chose Dataquest is because they emphasize project-based learning which is something that I lacked. Through the course I was able to build out a wide range of Data Science projects, helping further my development as a Data Scientist. 

With this experience I was able to begin working on my own data science projects from scratch. This website is a portfolio of the projects that I'm most proud of, featuring projects from my courses and personal projects.
